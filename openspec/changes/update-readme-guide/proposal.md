## Why
The current README omits recent capabilities (such as the dual newest sort modes), lacks onboarding context for server mode and dashboard usage, and doesn't provide prerequisites for building or running the project. Improving the README will help new contributors and operators set up the tool without diving into source code.

## What Changes
- Document prerequisites and a quick-start workflow for both CLI and server usage.
- Update the dashboard description to reflect the new star-time default and fetch-time option.
- Expand configuration guidance with environment variable scopes and tips for scheduling.

## Impact
- Clarifies setup for newcomers while keeping existing operators informed about behaviour changes.
- No code changes required; documentation only.
- Helps align README with the current spec so UI/API expectations stay consistent.
